    <h1>Ronaldo History</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        Cristiano Ronaldo, born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, is widely regarded as one of the
        greatest footballers of all time. His journey from a small island to the pinnacle of world football is a story of
        immense talent, relentless work ethic, and unyielding ambition.
    
    Ronaldo began his football career with Andorinha, a local club, before moving to Nacional. His prodigious talent
        caught the eye of Sporting CP, one of Portugal's top clubs, where he joined their youth academy in 1997. Ronaldo's
        performances for Sporting CP's first team, particularly in a friendly against Manchester United in 2003, impressed
        United's then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson, leading to his transfer to the English club for £12.24 million—a record fee
        for a teenager at the time.
    
    At Manchester United, Ronaldo developed from a raw, talented winger into a complete forward. He won three Premier
        League titles, a UEFA Champions League title, and numerous individual awards, including his first Ballon d'Or in
        2008. Known for his extraordinary speed, dribbling, and goal-scoring ability, Ronaldo's time at United solidified
        his status as one of the best players in the world.</p>
    
    In 2009, Ronaldo made a then-world record transfer to Real Madrid for €94 million. His tenure at Madrid was marked by
        unprecedented success. Ronaldo became the club's all-time leading scorer, amassing 450 goals in 438 appearances. He
        won four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, and four Ballon d'Or awards during his nine years in Madrid.
        His fierce rivalry with Barcelona's Lionel Messi defined an era in football.
    
    
        In 2018, Ronaldo transferred to Juventus for €100 million. In Italy, he continued his prolific scoring, helping
        Juventus win two Serie A titles and further cementing his legacy as one of the greatest goal-scorers in history.
    
        Internationally, Ronaldo has been a stalwart for Portugal. He debuted for the national team in 2003 and has since
        become their all-time top scorer and most-capped player. He led Portugal to their first major international trophy
        at Euro 2016 and a victory in the 2019 UEFA Nations League.
    
        In 2021, Ronaldo returned to Manchester United, continuing to break records and deliver standout performances.
        Beyond his on-field achievements, Ronaldo is known for his philanthropy and business ventures, including his CR7
        brand.
    
        Cristiano Ronaldo's career is a testament to his extraordinary talent, dedication, and ability to perform at the
        highest level across different leagues and international competitions. His impact on the sport is profound,
        inspiring countless aspiring footballers worldwide.
